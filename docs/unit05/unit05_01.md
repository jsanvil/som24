## User Profiles and Local Groups Management

### User Accounts

For an operating system, a **user account** is identified as the **combination** of a **name** and certain **authentication information** by which the user demonstrates they are authorized to use it. This authentication information is usually a **password**, but it could be replaced by other methods, such as an electronic ID card or another type of smart card, or even more futuristic methods, such as fingerprint or iris recognition, etc.

!!!note "Two-Step Authentication"

    Recently, two-step authentication has become essential for many of the services we use on the Internet. The idea is very simple: create a mechanism that increases security by verifying the user's identity through two different means:

    1. _Something we **KNOW**_

        For example, a username and a password.

    2. _Something we **HAVE**_: For example, a mobile phone, where we will receive a text message with an access code.

    This way, even if an unauthorized person discovers our username and password, they will still need our phone to access the account, and it must be unlocked.

    As expected, the received access code will be for one-time use and will expire after a certain period, depending on the service provider.

Normally, a user account is associated with a person who authenticates to use the computer. However, in certain situations, it may be a program on a computer that needs to authenticate to a server to obtain a specific resource or service.

When authentication uses a *password*, it must have sufficient complexity because it serves a dual purpose:

- Prevents access by unauthorized individuals.
- Associates that access with an individual who will be responsible for it.

For this reason, the use of user accounts by multiple people indiscriminately should be avoided at all costs.

!!!warning "Password complexity"

    When necessary, a protocol will be established to ensure sufficient complexity in user passwords. For example, by using various types of characters (uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and/or digits) and setting a minimum length.

In general, operating systems usually have three different types of accounts, with which their respective users will have different levels of control over the system. These are:

- **Standard accounts**: Generally, they can **perform user tasks** that are **not** administrative in nature.

- **Administrator accounts**: They offer control over all aspects of the operating system, so they **should be used with caution** and only for the activities they are intended for.

- **Guest accounts**: They are usually used to allow **occasional users** to use the system. Their capabilities are very limited.

    !!!note "Guest User Accounts"

        Guest user accounts can be very useful when using the computer for demonstrations or when offering its use to different people over time (hotels, restaurants, etc).

        In other contexts, when they are not needed, it may be convenient to disable them for security reasons.


On the other hand, the concept of a **user account** is associated with the concept of a **session**. We understand **session** as **the consecutive time during which a user account is active** in the operating system. Therefore, it extends from the moment the user authenticates, which is known as **logging in**, until they leave the system, which is known as **logging out**.

Additionally, a **user account** is associated with a set of **permissions** and **privileges**.

- **Privileges** define _**what the user can do**_ in the system once the session is started, _for example, shutting down the system, making backups, change the system time, load a device driver, etc._.
- **Permissions** define _**where access is granted**_ and under what conditions. A permission is linked to an object, such as a file, folder, or printer. _For example, reading, writing, or executing a specific file or folder_

When a privilege conflicts with a permission, the **privilege always takes precedence**. _For example, a user with backup privileges can copy all files, even if they do not have read permissions for them._

Another aspect related to user accounts is **user profiles**. These define the **appearance** and **configuration** of each specific user, from the desktop background or the set of icons used to the documents they work with or the files they have downloaded.

Therefore, when a user logs into an account for the first time, they will encounter a work environment with all **default values**, even if the system has been used by other accounts for an extended period and those accounts have been previously customized.

In general, according to their **scope**, there are several **types of accounts**:

- **Local accounts**: Authentication is handled by the operating system of the computer where we authenticate, and it only provides access to its resources. To authenticate with the same credentials on different computers, identical accounts must be created on each of them. Even so, each account will only provide access to the resources of the computer where it is located.

- **Network user accounts**: Typically, authentication is handled by **a computer acting as a server** on the network, and when successful, it allows access to resources offered by different computers on that network. Therefore, we can use the same account to access from different computers belonging to the same network.

- **Microsoft user accounts**: This is a particular case for _MS Windows_ operating systems, which associate a user account with an email address and a password, so that all account information is stored on _Microsoft_'s servers, allowing all configurations and preferences to be shared automatically across all devices using the same authentication credentials. In reality, we could consider this a particular case of a network user account.

Logically, user administration becomes more important as the number of users with diverse characteristics increases. In any case, in this document, we will refer exclusively to local user accounts.

### Local User Accounts

We have indicated that most operating systems have three types of accounts: Administrator, User, and Guest. However, in the latest versions of the *Microsoft* operating system, there has been a reinterpretation of this concept, providing three types of accounts:

- Administrator accounts
- Standard accounts
- Child accounts

If you are the one who installed the operating system, *MS Windows* assumes that you will be one of its administrators. We will be able to make any changes to its configuration, add new user accounts, install or remove programs, view or modify the content of any file on the computer, install or configure any hardware device, etc.

As expected, any computer with *MS Windows* must have at least one administrative account, even if we do not plan to perform administrative tasks frequently.

Standard accounts are designed for users who do not need to make any of the aforementioned changes to the system. From these accounts, any daily work can be carried out, but administrative tasks cannot be performed.

These types of accounts are perfect for the daily use of any user, including the one who performs administrative tasks. Keep in mind that if you are an administrator user and run a program, it can use your privileges to alter the system. For example, a virus that has infected the program we are using will have a much harder time spreading to the rest of the system when we use a standard account than if we do so with an administrator account. Therefore, it is recommended that the user who performs administrative tasks has two user accounts: one to administer the computer and another for daily use.

On the other hand, in *MS Windows*, to perform administrative tasks from a standard user account, you only need to know the password of an administrator account.

Child accounts are simply standard user accounts with **parental controls** enabled. For this reason, these types of accounts do not appear individually in the *MS Windows* *Control Panel*.

---

### Creating a Standard User Account in Windows 11

We can easily add standard accounts from the "_**Settings panel**_".

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Open the "_**Settings panel**_", select "_**Accounts**_" and go to "_**Other users**_"](./u6_1/user1.png){width=70%}
    <figcaption>Open the Settings panel, select "Accounts" and go to "Other users"</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure markdown="span">

    ![Once the process is finished, it will appear in the list](./u6_1/user4.png){width=70%}
    <figcaption>Once the process is finished, it will appear in the list</figcaption>
</figure>

---

To manage users more comprehensively, we must use the "_**Local Users and Groups Manager**_". We can access the tool by running the command **`lusrmgr.msc`** or by right-clicking on the Start menu icon, opening "_**Computer Management**_" and selecting "_**Local Users and Groups**_"

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Computer Management > Local Users and Groups](./u6_1/user5.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Computer Management > Local Users and Groups</figcaption>
</figure>

Right-clicking on a user brings up a context menu from which we can perform various actions. Generally, we will open the "_**Properties**_".

By default, we will be on the "_**General**_" tab, which contains the same data we entered when we created it, although now there is an additional option that allows us to lock the account.

We also have two new tabs that will allow us to adjust the profile characteristics of the user account and check the groups to which it belongs.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![User properties](./u6_1/user6.png){width=85%}
    <figcaption>User properties</figcaption>
</figure>

---

### Groups

In a business environment, even a medium or small one, we might find ourselves needing to create different user accounts with the same permissions and privileges. In such cases, we could end up configuring the same characteristics repeatedly for different accounts.

The solution in these situations is **user groups**. The idea is to create a group that holds the common permissions and privileges. Once the group is created, we only need to **make the user accounts _members_ of the group** to **inherit** all the **characteristics** we established for it.

When a new user needs to share the characteristics of the previous ones, it will be enough to make them a member of the group. Similarly, if a user should no longer have certain permissions, it will be enough to remove their account from the group members.

Additionally, **a user account can be a member of more than one group**, making it very easy to group resources with common characteristics into groups and control which users access them.

There are two types of group accounts according to their scope of influence:

- **Local group accounts**: Their scope will be the computer on which they were created, and their members will be local user accounts.

- **Network group accounts**: Their use is oriented towards network installations, where resources are offered to all client computers on that network. Therefore, they will have permissions and privileges related to the shared resources on the network, and their members will be network user accounts.

In our case, we will focus exclusively on local group accounts.

---

### Local Groups in Windows

When we install the system, a series of groups are automatically created with a default configuration that facilitates the assignment of privileges.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Built-in groups into the MS Windows 11 operating system](./u6_1/groups1.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Built-in groups into the MS Windows 11 operating system</figcaption>
</figure>

Some of the groups that exist by default in Windows are:

- **Administrators**. Users in this group have full and unrestricted access to the computer.
- **Guests**. Users in this group have more restricted access to the system than a standard user.
- **Network Configuration Operators**. This group grants its members privileges to manage network settings.
- **Backup Operators**. This group includes users with permissions to back up or restore files.
- **Users**. All standard users belong to this group, which prevents users from making accidental changes that could affect the system.
- **Remote Desktop Users**. Users in this group can log in remotely.

---

To create a group account, we will use the **`lusrmgr.msc`** tool, or alternatively, the "_**Computer Management**_" panel.

Within the "_**Groups**_" section, right-clicking opens a dialog where we select "_**New Group...**_"

We can add users using the "_**Add...**_" button.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Create a new group](./u6_1/groups2.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Create a new group</figcaption>
</figure>

To search for users, click the "_**Advanced options...**_" button.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Dialog for selecting users](./u6_1/groups3.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Dialog for selecting users</figcaption>
</figure>

---

If we click the "_**Find Now**_" button, it will display the complete list of users and groups on the system.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Advanced dialog for selecting users](./u6_1/groups4.png){width=70%}
    <figcaption>Advanced dialog for selecting users</figcaption>
</figure>

Once added, it will appear in the list of members of the new group.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Dialog for creating a new group with a member added](./u6_1/groups5.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Dialog for creating a new group with a member added</figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- ![Diálogo de creación de nuevo grupo con un miembro añadido](u6_1/groups5.png){width=50%} -->

We can go to the **user's properties** and in the "_**Member of**_" section, it will show which groups the user belongs to.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Groups to which a user belongs](./u6_1/groups6.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Groups to which a user belongs</figcaption>

### Managing Local Password Policies and Account Lockout

We can manage the system's security level by modifying the password and account lockout policies.

Password policies allow us to adjust the parameters for complexity and validity.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Local Computer Policy / Computer Configuration / Windows Settings / Security Settings / Account Policies / Password Policy](./u6_1/polices1.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Local Computer Policy / Computer Configuration / Windows Settings / Security Settings / Account Policies / Password Policy</figcaption>
</figure>

In the account lockout policies, we can define the number of incorrect attempts before the user account is locked, and for how long it will remain locked.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Local Computer Policy / Computer Configuration / Windows Settings / Security Settings / Account Policies / Account Lockout Policy](./u6_1/polices2.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Local Computer Policy / Computer Configuration / Windows Settings / Security Settings / Account Policies / Account Lockout Policy</figcaption>
</figure>

## File System Management

The operating system must control which users can access each of the resources it manages, such as files, directories, printers, network connections, etc.

Typically, systems use **Access Control Lists** or *ACLs* to achieve this. These lists are associated with resources and specify the different users and groups who can access them and under what conditions (read, write, execute, etc.).

Additionally, each file can have different attributes associated with it, which provide information about certain characteristics of the file or how the operating system should handle it. For example, a file can have attributes such as directory, hidden, system, encrypted, etc.

Now that we know different aspects of users and groups, we are ready to learn how to modify restrictions on the use of files and directories.

### Directory Permissions in MS Windows

One of the first things we need to know about the directory structure in *MS Windows* is that **each user account** that logs into the system will **have a folder** where all the configuration related to that user's work environment will be stored, including aspects such as screen settings, network connections, printer configurations, etc.

This information, known as the **user profile**, is organized into different files that are created when the user logs in for the first time.

In this way, the operating system ensures that multiple users can use the same computer and that each one finds, upon logging in, the same environment they left when they logged out previously. Additionally, changes made by one user in personalizing their workspace will not affect any other user on the computer.

These folders are located within the volume where the operating system is installed, usually at **`C:\Users`**.

When a user from the _Administrators_ group tries to access another user's profile folder, they receive a **warning** informing them that they do not have permission to do so. However, since they have sufficient privileges, they can click the "_Continue_" button to access its contents.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Request for permission to access another user's profile](./u6_1/files1.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Request for permission to access another user's profile</figcaption>
</figure>

---

However, the change in permissions will only be completed if approved by a user with administrative privileges, as the system will display a window requesting their password.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Request for permission to access another user's profile](./u6_1/files2.png){width=45%}
    <figcaption>Request for permission to access another user's profile</figcaption>
</figure>

### Sharing the Profile with another user

As mentioned above, a user who does not belong to the administrators group can only access another user's data with the approval of an administrator user.

It is always possible for a user to voluntarily share their profile with a different user. This can be done individually with a specific user or with all members of a group.

_Right-click_ on the folder that matches your account name. In the context menu that appears, choose the "_**Grant access to**_" entry.

A new menu will appear with several options, including the names of different users on the system. If you want to share the folder with a single user and only grant them read permission to your files, simply click on their name.

Additionally, we have an option titled "_**Specific users...**_", which will allow us to add multiple users at once and change their permissions (the actions they can perform) on our files.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Context menu to grant access to specific users](./u6_1/files3.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Context menu to grant access to specific users</figcaption>
</figure>

In the dropdown, we can select _users_. Once added, we can modify the permissions.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Dialog to add users and permissions to a folder](./u6_1/files4.png){width=70%}
    <figcaption>Dialog to add users and permissions to a folder</figcaption>
</figure>

Lastly, if there are subdirectories, it will ask for confirmation to change the settings.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Confirmation of changing permissions in subdirectories](./u6_1/files5.png){width=70%}
    <figcaption>Confirmation of changing permissions in subdirectories</figcaption>
</figure>

On the other hand, we can specify specific permissions from the "_**Security**_" section of the directory properties by clicking the "_**Edit...**_" button.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Directory properties > Security > Edit...](./u6_1/files6.png){width=100%}
    <figcaption>Directory properties > Security > Edit...</figcaption>
</figure>

### NTFS Permissions and Inheritance

The standard _**NTFS**_ permissions that can be assigned to a folder are:

- **Full control**: to read, change, create, and execute programs or folders.
- **Read & execute**: to view the content and run programs in a folder.
- **Modify**: to change files and folders, but not create or delete new files or folders.
- **Read**: to view and open the content.
- **Write**: to create and change existing files and folders.
- **List folder contents**.

These permissions can be assigned to users or groups, and could be **granted** or **denied**. When a permission is **denied**, it **takes precedence over** any permission that is **granted**.

The **inheritance** describes **how the permissions propagate** through the resources a folder contains.

**By default**, when a folder is created, it **inherits** the permissions of its parent folder. This means that the permissions of the parent folder are copied to the new folder.

**Explicit** permissions, unlike inherited permissions, are those **configured directly** on a resource. That is, those established specifically for that particular resource.

Sometimes, it may be necessary for permissions not to be inherited downwards, but to be maintained at the same level. In these cases, it is necessary to **break inheritance**. This can be done by selecting the "_**Disable inheritance**_" option. Once inheritance is disabled, the permissions of the parent folder will no longer be copied to the child folder.

In these cases, one of the following paths should be taken:

- Redefine the permissions explicitly.
- Remove inheritance on the child object.
- Remove inheritance at the parent level, which will stop the downward extension (to the children).

To control inheritance, we must access "_**Advanced options**_" within the "_**Security**_" section.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Directory properties > Security > Advanced](./u6_1/files7.png){width=100%}
    <figcaption>Directory properties > Security > Advanced</figcaption>
</figure>

### Access to the Common Folder

Within the `C:\Users` folder, there is a folder that can be used by all users of the computer to share information. This is the "_**Public**_" folder located at **`C:\Users\Public`**.

By default, all users have read permissions for this folder. However, if we want to share files with other users, we can create a subfolder and grant them the necessary permissions.

## Processes and Priorities

The main memory of the computer can host hundreds of tasks that take turns using the processor. One way the operating system improves performance is by assigning different priorities to these tasks.

A good general approach is to give **higher priority** to processes that perform **interactive tasks**, meaning those that **communicate directly with the user**. These processes require a quick response from the system to provide a good user experience. On the other hand, processes that do not interact with the user can run at a **lower priority**.

Interactive processes are said to run in the **foreground**, while those that are not are said to run in the **background**.

As expected, a process running at a **higher priority** will have **more processor time** than one running at a **lower priority**. This is because the operating system will allocate processor time to the process with the **highest priority first**.

An example of this can be the task responsible for printing a document. Printers are probably the slowest devices we use. Thus, the task responsible for printing only needs to obtain the processor's use occasionally to provide a sufficient data flow for the printing process. Therefore, this would be an ideal task to run at a low priority (in the background), and while it performs its job, interactive processes will continue to function almost as quickly as if we were not printing.

### Execution Priority in MS Windows

In general, *MS Windows* only allows us to choose whether interactive programs or background programs should run with higher priority.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Adjust processor performance](./u6_1/process1.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Adjust processor performance</figcaption>
</figure>

However, if you want to modify the priority of a particular task, you can always use the _Task Manager_.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Modify process priority](./u6_1/process2.png){width=70%}
    <figcaption>Modify process priority</figcaption>
</figure>

## System Performance

In general, we can define the concept of performance as the speed with which a computer performs the tasks assigned to it (both system-related and application and service-related). Initially, system performance will be limited by various aspects:

- Processor speed.
- The amount and speed of main memory.
- The speed of external storage devices (usually hard drives).
- The speed of network interfaces.

!!!tip

    Sometimes, one of the programs we are running in *MS Windows* stops working and we have no way to close it. There is a simple solution: restart the system.

    However, this forces us to save the files we are working on in other applications, wait for the system to shut down and restart, and finally, reopen the applications and files.

In _MS Windows_ operating systems, we have the **Task Manager**, a tool that allows us to examine system performance data and identify potential bottlenecks.

To start the **Task Manager**, simply _right-click_ on the "_Start_" icon or press the `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Del` key combination.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Task Manager in the "Performance" section](./u6_1/process3.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Task Manager in the "Performance" section</figcaption>
</figure>

To get detailed information about the resources each process is consuming, there is a tool called **Resource Monitor**.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Resource Monitor](./u6_1/process4.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Resource Monitor</figcaption>
</figure>

## System Activity Monitoring

In a modern operating system, all important actions are recorded in an **event log**. These records include warning messages and errors, and it is important to monitor them periodically to ensure there are no significant issues. If there are, we have the opportunity to resolve them before they have serious repercussions.

The _MS Windows_ tool that allows us to view and manage events logged by both system services and various applications is called the **Event Viewer**. It provides a powerful and centralized way to understand what is happening in our operating system.

The **Event Viewer** is essential for monitoring server performance and resolving any issues. From it, we can perform the following tasks:

- **View the events** that have occurred.
- **Create filters** for the events that interest us most and save them as custom views that we can reuse at any time.
- **Schedule a task** to run in response to a specific situation.
- **Set up subscriptions** to certain events.

Events are classified into different **categories**:

1. *Custom Views*: Allow us to restrict the events shown based on our preferences.
2. *Windows Logs*: Store events related to the entire system and legacy applications.
3. *Applications and Services Logs*: Contain events related to specific applications or components.
4. *Subscriptions*: Used to collect events from other networked computers and store them locally.

The _MS Windows Logs_ category acts as a container for several subcategories that will be familiar to advanced users of other Microsoft desktop systems. Specifically, we find the following:

- *Application*: Here, applications and services that are not part of the system log their events.
- *Security*: Includes information on events related to system security.
- *Setup*: Where information on events related to the configuration of roles and features is logged.
- *System*: Contains information on system events and its components.
- *Forwarded Events*: Contains information forwarded by other systems on the network.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Event Viewer](./u6_1/events1.png){width=90%}
    <figcaption>Event Viewer</figcaption>
</figure>

---

## Service Management

Services are a particular type of process that usually runs in the background, meaning the user is not directly aware of their presence and typically waits for a specific event to provide a certain service to the user.

During the operating system's startup, numerous services are initiated, occupying memory and processor time. Some of them may never be needed.

If we want to maximize our computer's processing capacity, we might consider disabling services that are not necessary for our use of the computer. However, we must keep in mind that, in most cases, their operation is highly optimized (especially those of the operating system itself) and, if not used, they soon get paged to disk. Additionally, we should consider two main drawbacks:

- If we disable a service necessary for the operating system, it may stop functioning correctly.
- A service that is not needed at the moment and is disabled will need to be re-enabled in the future if it becomes necessary.

In any case, as the number of installed programs increases, there may be less optimized services. Even in systems like Windows, services associated with a particular program may remain running even after the program has been uninstalled. There may even be services acting as spyware. For all these reasons, it is useful to know how to manage system services.

If you are considering disabling some services on your system, the following table provides some suggestions:

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Windows Services](./u6_1/services.png){width=80%}
    <figcaption>Windows Services</figcaption>
</figure>

A typical example would be restarting the "Print Spooler" service when there are pending jobs:

<figure markdown="span">
    ![Restarting the "Print Spooler" service](./u6_1/services2.png){width=90%}
    <figcaption>Restarting the "Print Spooler" service</figcaption>
</figure>

## Storage Device Management

When we need more disk storage space, we can compress files, move them to an external storage device, or even delete those we no longer need. However, a good alternative is to add a new hard drive to our system. Hard drives have a great price-to-storage capacity ratio and are very easy to install.

Moreover, in most cases, the computer will automatically detect them, and we will only need to configure the operating system to use them.

In this section, we will assume that the hardware part is already resolved. That is, you have already opened the computer and correctly connected a new hard drive inside it. Here, we will focus on the adjustments we need to make in the operating system to get the most out of it.

In Windows, configuring a disk that has been added inside the computer or connected via a USB port is practically identical, except that external disks usually come partitioned and formatted from the factory (although we can always erase the previous structure and start from scratch).

!!!note
    When referring to *volume* or *partition*, we are talking about the same thing, a logical division in a storage unit.

In any case, in _MS Windows_, we can use two different ways to configure disks:

- **Basic**: This is used by most personal computers because it is the easiest to manage. In the basic configuration, each partition (or volume) is an independent entity, so it cannot share data with other partitions.

- **Dynamic**: This configuration was introduced in _Microsoft_ operating systems starting with _MS Windows 2000_, and it can share a large number of volumes, we can create up to 1000 dynamic volumes per disk group, although boot time increases as the number of volumes increases. The recommended number of dynamic volumes is 32 or fewer per disk group.

    **Types of dynamic volumes:**

    - **Simple**: The disks will behave in the usual way. This type of volume can be mirrored but is not fault-tolerant.

    - **Mirrored**: Two identical copies of a volume are created, appearing as a single entity. Each write is replicated on the mirror disks, and simultaneous reads of different data can be performed, increasing performance. The different disks can operate independently (with different controllers), so if one disk fails, the system can continue to function from the one that remains active. This increases fault tolerance.
    
        Logically, disks with the same characteristics should be used. Otherwise, the capacity of the smallest disk is taken as a reference.
    
        This configuration is equivalent to **RAID-1**.

    - **Striped**: Uses several disks to create a single logical unit, allowing the available space to be used very efficiently. It achieves a performance improvement in both reading and writing because operations are carried out on different disks simultaneously.
    
        In this configuration, volumes cannot be mirrored and are not fault-tolerant.

    - **Spanned**: A variant of the previous one. Although it improves performance, it is more vulnerable to write errors.

        Disks with the same characteristics should be used. Otherwise, the capacity of the smallest disk is taken as a reference.

        This configuration is equivalent to **RAID-0**.
    
    - **RAID-5**: Distributes data across three or more disks, using one of them (which alternates) to store parity information that allows data recovery when a disk fails. Therefore, it is fault-tolerant. It improves efficiency compared to the previous ones, although the parity calculation slightly penalizes write performance.


### Basic RAID Levels

Among all the storage devices present in the computer, hard drives offer the lowest performance.

To mitigate this problem, the RAID standard (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) was developed. RAID is a system that stores data using different storage devices (hard drives or SSDs) to create a single logical volume.

With RAID, performance is improved in two ways:

- If the sought data is **duplicated** on multiple disks, we can use the one that offers the best performance.

- If the sought data is **distributed** across multiple disks, we can perform parallel reading.

Additionally, redundancy can be included to **improve the reliability** of the storage medium and compensate for the increased probability of failure as the number of involved devices increases.

The disk array can be managed by a hardware controller or specific software, but in any case, the system will see it as a single volume. Moreover, the volume capacity can grow gradually by increasing the number of involved devices.

The basic definition of RAID consists of seven levels, numbered from 0 to 6, to which some complementary levels were later added.

#### RAID 0 (or disk striping)

Distributes data across the disks in the array, allowing for parallel reading or writing of blocks, significantly increasing performance.

Data is organized into strips, which can correspond to physical blocks or sectors. This way, the operating system handles them as if they were a single disk.

The strips are assigned in a rotating manner among the disks in the array. Thus, when a read operation involves several consecutive strips, they can be read in parallel, greatly enhancing performance.

    <figcaption>RAID-0 configuration diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

Unlike other RAID levels, this one does not offer redundancy. This means that if a disk fails, all data would be lost, and we would only have to rely on backups. In return, it offers high performance, which increases with the number of disks, and the utilization of storage capacity is maximized.

#### RAID 1 (or mirroring)

Unlike the previous case, which did not consider redundancy, here it is complete, as it is achieved by duplicating all stored content. It would be like RAID 0, but assigning each strip to two different disks. In this way, we will have pairs of twin disks.

Obviously, its main drawback is the cost.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![RAID-1 configuration diagram](./u6_1/Raid1.png){width=25%}
    <figcaption>RAID-1 configuration diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

However, in RAID 1, parallel reads of two different strips can be performed, or a strip can be obtained from the disk that offers the highest speed at any given moment (shorter seek time and latency). However, writes will be duplicated and will be performed at the speed of the slowest device in the pair.

Additionally, when a disk fails, the data remains available, and it is enough to replace the damaged disk for the data to be duplicated again and restore the functionality of the array. When accessing data with a failed disk, it is said to be operating in degraded mode.

#### RAID 5

A RAID 5 (also called distributed with parity) is a block-level data striping with distributed parity information among all the disks in the array. RAID 5 has gained popularity due to its low redundancy cost. Generally, RAID 5 is implemented with hardware support for parity calculation.

RAID 5 requires a minimum of 3 disks to be implemented, and the theoretical maximum is unlimited.

Its main advantage is that data can be recovered in the event of a single disk failure, but the failure of a second disk results in complete data loss.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![RAID-5 configuration diagram](./u6_1/Raid5.png){width=45%}
    <figcaption>RAID-5 configuration diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

**Parity Calculation**

In **Boolean algebra**, there is an operation called "**exclusive or**" (**XOR**), which means "**either one or the other but not both**", that is:

```
0 XOR 0 = 0
0 XOR 1 = 1
1 XOR 0 = 1
1 XOR 1 = 0
```

The XOR operator is the central piece that defines how parity is created and used in RAID. It is used both for data protection and for recovering lost data.

#### RAID 6

Its structure is like RAID 5, but adding a complementary parity control, which is stored in the corresponding stripe of an independent disk. This means we will need one more disk.

<figure markdown="span">
    ![RAID-6 configuration diagram](./u6_1/Raid6.png){width=45%}
    <figcaption>RAID-6 configuration diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

Its great advantage is that data can be recovered even if two disks fail simultaneously (i.e., during the time it takes to regenerate the array after a failure).

Its main drawback is that each write incurs a higher penalty, as two parity blocks must be calculated.

#### RAID 5E and RAID 6E

These are RAID 5 and RAID 6 levels that include spare disks. When the disks are connected and ready to use, they are called *hot spare*. If they are in standby mode, they are called *standby spare*.

The only contribution these configurations offer is the quick response in case of a failure.

#### RAID 0+1

This is a nesting of RAID 0 and RAID 1, where a set of disks is created to divide the information, and then a mirror of the obtained volume is created.

It is also often called RAID 01, but it should not be confused with RAID 1.

    ![RAID 0+1 configuration diagram](./u6_1/Raid0-1.png){width=45%}
    <figcaption>RAID 0+1 configuration diagram</figcaption>
</figure>

#### RAID 1+0

In this case, the nesting is reversed, creating two RAID 1 structures that are then combined to create a RAID 0 volume.

It is often referred to as RAID 10.

## Network Device Configuration

Currently, computers usually obtain their *IP address* from a *DHCP server*.

In large local networks, this server can be one of the computers connected to the network, but in smaller networks (including home networks), it is likely that the task is performed by the router that provides Internet access.

!!!note
    **DHCP** stands for _Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol_.

    It is a client-server network protocol through which a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks.

In any case, either because we do not have a *DHCP server* on our network or because the computer we are using needs to be easily locatable (for example, when sharing storage space or a printer), it may be useful to assign a *static IP address* to the computer. This way, the *IP address* value will not change with each startup.

We will set fixed values for the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and even the primary DNS server that the computer should use to resolve Internet addresses.

---

The easiest way to solve this task is to right-click on the network connection icon in the *Taskbar* and select "*Network & Internet settings*"

![Configuración de red e internet](u6_1/net1.png)

Al hacerlo, se abrirá la ventana de *Configuración* mostrando los ajustes de la categoría *Red e Internet*.

![Configuración > Red e Internet](u6_1/net2.png)

---

Para configurar los dispositivos de red, debemos elegir la primera opción "*Ethernet*"

![Configuración > Red e Internet > Ethernet](u6_1/net3.png){width=85%}

---

Para configurar el dispositivo, debemos pulsar el botón "Editar" del apartado "Asignación de IP"

![Asignación de IP DHCP](u6_1/net4.png)

Al cambiar a "Manual" nos permitirá introducir los parámetros de la IP fija.

![Asignación de IP Manual](u6_1/net5.png){width=30%}

---

De manera alternativa, podemos la herramienta de "*Conexiones de red*" del "*Panel de control*"

![Conexiones de red](u6_1/net6.png)

---

Al abrir las Propiedades de un adaptador de red aparece un diálogo donde podremos configurar todos los elementos del adaptador. Para configurar la dirección IP seleccionaremos "*Protocolo de Internet versión 4(TCP/IPv4)*" y haremos clic en "Propiedades", lo que nos permitirá establecer la configuración de red de forma manual.

![Propiedades del adaptador de red](u6_1/net7.png)

Para comprobar el estado del adaptador de red a través de la línea de comandos podemos utilizar el comando `ipconfig`

![ipconfig](u6_1/net8.png)

Para obtener información detallada podemos utilizar `ipconfig /all`

![ipconfig /all](u6_1/net9.png)

Otro comando muy utilizado es `ping` que comprueba la comunicación con un equipo remoto de la red.

## Automatización de tareas

Los sistemas operativos suelen incluir herramientas que nos permiten evitar la realización manual de tareas administrativas que se repiten de forma sistemática a lo largo del tiempo (como las copias de seguridad) o que se realizan a horas intempestivas para evitar comprometer el rendimiento del equipo en los momentos en los que más falta haga (como la descarga e instalación de actualizaciones).

La automatización de tareas del sistema nos permite programar la ejecución de programas o secuencias de comandos, para que se produzca a una hora determinada y, en su caso, con una frecuencia en particular.

En el caso de *Windows*, esta situación la cubre el *Programador de tareas*, que nos permite automatizar tareas en función de que se produzcan diferentes circunstancias:

- Cuando llegue un momento particular del futuro.
- Cuando se produzca un determinado evento.
- Con una frecuencia determinada, indicada por el usuario.

Por lo tanto, podemos utilizar las tareas programadas para automatizar ciertas acciones que se repiten a lo largo del tiempo, evitando así molestias y olvidos ocasionales. Por ejemplo, podríamos conseguir que el ordenador se apagara de forma automática, todos los días laborales, sin que tengamos que desplazarnos físicamente hasta donde se encuentra.

También podríamos, por ejemplo, conseguir que el antivirus que tengamos instalado realice un análisis completo del sistema todos los domingos a las 3 de la madrugada, aprovechando el momento de menor carga de trabajo del servidor.

Una de las ventajas del Programador de tareas de *Windows* es que incorpora una biblioteca de tareas programadas y las mantiene organizadas y accesibles, de modo que resulta fácil administrarlas (deshabilitarlas, modificarlas, eliminarlas o ejecutarlas).

En *Windows*, la frecuencia con la que se repita la acción puede ser:

- Diariamente
- Semanalmente
- Mensualmente
- Una vez
- Al iniciarse el equipo (antes de que un usuario inicie sesión)
- Al iniciar la sesión (sólo después de que el usuario actual inicie sesión)
- Cuando se registre un evento específico

Podemos acceder a la herramienta "Programador de tareas" mediante el panel de Administración de equipos.

Para crear una nueva tarea, podemos utilizar el asistente con la opción "Crear tarea básica..." o el modo avanzado con la opción "Crear tarea..."

![Programador de tareas](u6_1/task1.png){width=80%}

Al abrir seleccionar "Crear tarea básica..." aparece un diálogo con un asistente. El primer paso es indicar el nombre y una descripción:

![Asistente para crear tarea básica](u6_1/task2.png){width=70%}

A continuación pregunta cuál será el evento que desencadenará la ejecución de la tarea.

![Asistente para crear tarea básica - Desencadenante](u6_1/task3.png){width=70%}

Para el ejemplo, al seleccionar "Diariamente" como desencadenante, en el siguiente paso solicita la fecha de inicio, la hora a la que se ejecutará y cada cuántos días queremos que se repita la tarea.

![Asistente para crear tarea básica - Diariamente](u6_1/task4.png){width=70%}

En el siguiente paso solicita qué tipo de acción queremos que realice la tarea. Por lo general, se inicializará un programa.

![Asistente para crear tarea básica - Acción](u6_1/task5.png){width=70%}

En el último paso, indicaremos qué aplicación o script se iniciará. En nuestro caso, llamaremos al comando `shutdown /s /t 0`. Como puede verse, hay que indicar el comando por un lado y los argumentos en otro campo separado.

![Asistente para crear tarea básica - Iniciar un programa](u6_1/task6.png){width=70%}

Finalmente, como suele acostumbrar *Windows*, el sistema muestra un resumen para que revisemos todos los parámetros que hemos configurado.

![Asistente para crear tarea básica - Resumen](u6_1/task7.png){width=60%}

Al volver a la ventana principal del *Programador de tareas* veremos que se ha creado la nueva tarea. Si abrimos sus propiedades podemos consultar y ajustar los parámetros.
