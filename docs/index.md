# Course Outline

## Unit 1. **Characterization of Operating Systems (SO)**

> This involves understanding and describing the key features, functionalities, and types of operating systems. It includes knowing how they manage hardware resources, provide user interfaces, and support applications.

## Unit 2. **Virtualization**

> Virtualization refers to the creation of virtual versions of physical components such as servers, storage devices, or operating systems. It allows multiple virtual environments to run on a single physical system, optimizing resource use and providing flexibility.

## Unit 3. **Installation of Windows Operating System**:

> This process involves setting up the Windows OS on a computer. It includes preparing the installation media, configuring settings, and completing the installation process.

## Unit 4. **Exploitation of Windows OS GUI**:

> This refers to using the graphical user interface (GUI) of Windows to perform tasks, such as navigating the system, managing files, and using applications.

## Unit 5. **Exploitation of Windows OS CLI**:

> This involves using the command-line interface (CLI) of Windows for tasks. The CLI allows users to execute commands, automate tasks, and manage system configurations via text-based input.

## Unit 6. **Administration of Windows OS**:

> This includes managing and maintaining a Windows operating system, such as configuring system settings, installing updates, managing user accounts, and troubleshooting issues.

## Unit 7. **Installation of Linux Operating System**:

> This involves setting up the Linux OS on a computer, which includes preparing the installation media, configuring partitions, and following installation steps specific to the Linux distribution.

## Unit 8. **Exploitation of Linux OS GUI**:

> This refers to using the graphical user interface of Linux distributions to perform tasks, similar to how one would use the GUI in Windows.

## Unit 9. **Exploitation of Linux OS CLI**:

> This involves using the command-line interface in Linux to perform various tasks. The CLI is a powerful tool for managing files, running scripts, and configuring system settings.

## Unit 10. **Administration of Linux OS**:

> This includes the tasks involved in managing and maintaining a Linux operating system, including system configuration, user management, updates, and troubleshooting.
