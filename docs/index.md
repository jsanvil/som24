# Course Outline

## Unit 1. **Characterization of Operating Systems (SO)** `RA1`

> This involves understanding and describing the key features, functionalities, and types of operating systems. It includes knowing how they manage hardware resources, provide user interfaces, and support applications.

## Unit 2. **Virtualization** `RA5`

> Virtualization refers to the creation of virtual versions of physical components such as servers, storage devices, or operating systems. It allows multiple virtual environments to run on a single physical system, optimizing resource use and providing flexibility.

## Unit 3. **Installation of Operating Systems** `RA2`

> This process involves setting up Operating Systems on a computer. It includes preparing the installation media, configuring settings, and completing the installation process.

## Unit 4. **Management of Operating systems** `RA3`

> This refers to using the graphical user interface (GUI) 

## Unit 5. **Administration of Operating Systems** `RA4`

> This involves using the command-line interface (CLI). The CLI allows users to execute commands, automate tasks, and manage system configurations via text-based input.
