<p>The <strong>installation</strong> of an operating system is a <strong>process by which the operating system is transferred to the computer in order to be configured and prepared for use</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>process</strong> of installing an operating system is divided into the following phases:</p>
<pre class="mermaid"><code>graph LR

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Planning the installation</strong>.</p>
<p>In this first phase we must consider some decisive factors for the installation, such as the <strong>selection of the operating system</strong>. It will also be necessary to check that the computer where the operating system will be installed meets the <strong>technical requirements</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preparation for installation</strong>.</p>
<p>After planning and checking the technical requirements of the operating system, it is necessary to determine a series of parameters that will affect the selected operating system, such as the <strong>partitions</strong> that we will make, the <strong>file system</strong> that we will use and the <strong>disk formatting</strong> process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Executing the installation</strong>.</p>
<p>In this phase we will follow all the steps of the installation wizard to install the operating system on the hard drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Installation configuration</strong>.</p>
<p>Once the operating system is installed, we will configure some parameters, such as the location, time zone, users, etc. We will also take the opportunity to install and configure the basic applications that we want to have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Installation documentation</strong>.</p>
<p>Document the entire process. There is no need to wait until the last minute to write the documentation, it is better to do it on each phase.</p>

<p>Before installing an operating system, it is necessary to plan the installation. This planning will help us to know the requirements of the operating system and the hardware where it will be installed.</p>
<p>There are a series of factors that need to be taken into account and analyzed carefully. Among others:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS Selection</strong><ul>
<li>System Purpose</li>
<li>Technical Requirements</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="os-selection">OS Selection<a class="headerlink" href="#os-selection" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>System purpose</strong>. This is the function that the system will perform, and it will depend on whether we want to use the computer as a server, a desktop computer, a laptop with a touch screen, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Technical requirements</strong>. The operating system must be compatible with the hardware of the computer where it will be installed.</li>
<li><strong>Application compatibility</strong>. The functionality of the computer can be very varied, from running applications that require few requirements to high-powered computers that run graphical applications.</li>
<li><strong>Technical support</strong>. With the installation of a current operating system we receive support directly from the company and updates that keep the computer updated until the end of its useful life.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>. Depending on the chosen operating system we will find different security measures. The most common are two-step authentication to protect user accounts or biometrics, secure storage of user credentials, inability to install applications that are not digitally signed, etc.</li>
<li><strong>License</strong>. Operating systems have different types of licenses, such as proprietary, open source, etc. The license will determine the use that can be made of the operating system.</li>
<li><strong>Price</strong>. The price of the operating system is a factor to consider when choosing an operating system. There are free operating systems and others that have a cost.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Proprietary Operating Systems</p>
<p><em>Proprietary</em> operating systems are those in which users have limited possibilities of modification, adaptation and distribution and where their license of use normally has an associated cost. In many cases, these proprietary operating systems come pre-installed from the factory with the equipment we buy, and although it may seem that we do not pay for them, we do, since the price is included in the total price of the system.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="technical-requirements">Technical requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-requirements" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>All operating systems have <strong>technical requirements</strong> that must be met in order to install them on the computer. To find out what they are, we must consult the <strong>official website</strong>.</p>
<p>These requirements usually refer to the <strong>processor</strong>, the <strong>RAM</strong>, the <strong>secondary storage</strong> capacity and the <strong>graphics card</strong> of the computer.</p>
<p>Most operating systems establish <strong>minimum requirements</strong> that must be met in order to install them on the computer and <strong>recommended requirements</strong> that will allow the operating system to work optimally.</p>
<p>Other operating system requirements in terms of functionality and features may include an Internet connection to take advantage of some of the features, microphones to activate voice recognition, touch screen equipment to activate touch mode or biometric equipment for authentication, among others.</p>
<h3 id="backup">Backup<a class="headerlink" href="#backup" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the computer we are installing on contains data from a previous installation, it is important to back up any information we need to preserve. Problems may arise during the installation process that could delete or make them inaccessible.</p>
<p>In order to backup important information, we can manually copy it to an external device or use a backup or cloning tool.</p>
<h3 id="installation-medium">Installation medium<a class="headerlink" href="#installation-medium" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>To install an operating system, we need an installation medium.</p>
<p>There are different formats or mediums such as USB, CD/DVD or ISO image. Also, if we need to install on several computers at the same time, we can do a network installation of a cloned image from a server.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ISO Image</strong>. It is a file that contains the installation of the operating system. It can be burned to a CD/DVD or copied to a USB stick.</li>
<li><strong>CD/DVD</strong>. It is a physical medium that contains the installation of the operating system. It is less common today.</li>
<li><strong>USB External Storage</strong>. It's the most common way to install an operating system.</li>
<li><strong>PXE</strong> (Preboot eXecution Environment). It is a standard that allows computers to boot from the network. It commonly used to install operating systems on several computers at the same time.<ul>
<li><em>Clonezilla is a good tool for cloning, backup and network installation</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On virtual machines, the installation medium is usually an ISO image that is mounted on the virtual machine as a CD/DVD.</p>
<h3 id="storage-and-partitions">Storage and partitions<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-and-partitions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before starting the installation process of an operating system, it is necessary to decide how the hard drive will be organized. Depending on the operating system we decide to install, different partitions will be created and a specific file system will be used. The following factors must be taken into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partition schemes.</li>
<li>File systems of proprietary operating systems.</li>
<li>Formatting a disk.</li>
<li>Cloning.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="partition-schemes">Partition schemes<a class="headerlink" href="#partition-schemes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>In order to use an storage drive, we first need to create the necessary partitions and format them to prepare it for the operating system you want to install. This process will give the storage drive a structure that will allow to store the files and applications that are part of the selected operating system.</p>
<p>An storage drive must have at least one partition.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Partition Table</strong>: A partition table is a <strong>data structure</strong> that <strong>stores information about the partitions</strong> on an storage drive. It is used by the operating system to <strong>identify and access the partitions</strong> on the storage drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Partition</strong>: A partition is a <strong>logical division</strong> of an storage drive that allows you to <strong>organize the information</strong> stored on it. <strong>Each partition can have its own file system</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Volume</strong>: A volume is a <strong>logical unit of storage</strong> that can be formatted with a file system. A volume <strong>can be a partition</strong>, but it can also be a <strong>combination of partitions</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File System</strong>: A file system is a <strong>method of organizing and storing files</strong> on a storage drive. It is a <strong>data structure</strong> that allows the operating system to <strong>access and manage files</strong> on the storage drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Formatting</strong>: Formatting is the process of <strong>preparing a storage drive</strong> to store information. It involves <strong>creating a file system</strong> on the storage drive so that the operating system can <strong>read and write data</strong> to it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before dividing it into different partitions and formatting an storage drive, we need to use a scheme known as a <strong>partition table</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Types of partition tables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MBR</strong> (<em>Master Boot Record</em>). This standard emerged in 1983 and is the most well-known style of tables, and it is still functional today. In this system you can only have <em>four primary partitions or three primary partitions and one extended partition</em>. We cannot create partitions larger than 2TB.</li>
<li><strong>GPT</strong> (<em>GUID Partition Table</em>). This is the current standard that replaces <em>MBR</em> in 64-bit systems and that arrived in 2000 with the new systems with unified extensible firmware interface (<em>UEFI</em>), which replaces the old <em>BIOS</em> systems. In this system, each partition has a <strong>globally unique identifier</strong> (<em>GUID</em>) and there is <strong>no limit on the number of partitions</strong> that can be created beyond the limit established by the operating systems themselves.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Hard disk management tools</p>
<p>We can find different applications that will allow us to manage the partitions on our hard disk, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>GParted</em></li>
<li><em>Partition Magic</em></li>
<li><em>Paragon Hard Disk Manager</em></li>
<li><em>Disk Director</em></li>
<li><em>Acronis Disk Director</em></li>
<li><em>AOMEI Partition Assistant</em></li>
</ul>
<p>With these applications we can <strong>create</strong> partitions, <strong>resize</strong>, <strong>format</strong> and even create <strong>images</strong> of the partitions.</p>
</div>
<p>In <strong>MBR</strong>, three types of partitions can be created:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary partition</strong>. These are the primary divisions of the disk.</p>
<p>There can only be four primary partitions or three primary and one extended. It is in this type of partition where operating systems are usually installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extended or secondary partition</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a type of partition that is used to contain different logical partitions within it.</p>
<p>There can <strong>only be one extended partition per disk</strong>, and it is only <strong>used to contain logical partitions</strong>. It is not used to store data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logical partition</strong>.</p>
<p>These types of partitions <strong>are found within the extended partitions</strong> and function as different units with their own file systems.</p>
<p>We can occupy all the space of the extended partition or only part of it. Theoretically we can have an unlimited number of logical partitions, although in practice this number is limited by the operating system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Partitions access in MS Windows</p>
<p>In <em>MS Windows</em> operating systems there is not just one directory hierarchy, but one for each accessible partition, so it is common to identify each of these hierarchies with a <strong>drive letter</strong>, although a system folder can also be assigned to access this partition. Thus, <strong>partitions are represented by a letter</strong> of the alphabet followed by the character "<strong><code>:</code></strong>", so the identifier of the root directory of a drive is <code>&lt;drive letter&gt;:\</code>. Some letters are reserved for special storage devices such as <code>A:</code> and <code>B:</code> for floppy disk drives and <strong><code>C:</code></strong> for the first partition on the first hard disk, known as the <strong>system partition</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="file-systems">File systems<a class="headerlink" href="#file-systems" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>An operating system's file systems are standards designed to indicate how files are stored, distributed, and organized on storage devices (ssd, hard drives, optical discs, USB drives, etc.).</p>
<p>Each operating system uses its own file system, although there are file systems that are compatible between different systems. The file system that an operating system uses by default is called <strong>native file system</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>MS Windows</em> operating system supports different file systems, the most common of which are <strong>FAT32</strong> and <strong>NTFS</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>FAT</strong> is the acronym for file allocation table. It was designed in 1977 by the Microsoft company. As disk sizes grew, this standard resulted in many variants: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, and exFAT.</p>
<p>The FAT32 file system allows partitions of up to 16 TiB in theory, although currently the limitation depends on the operating system. The exFAT file system is theoretically 64 ZiB.</p>
<p>A disk with a FAT file system is divided into clusters, the size of which is determined by the size of the partition. When a file is created, an entry is generated in the allocation table and the first cluster number that contains data is set.</p>
<p>A cluster is the minimum storage size of a hard disk.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>NTFS</strong> stands for <em>New Technology File System</em>. It was patented by Microsoft in 1993 and <strong>has now become the native file system for <em>MS Windows</em></strong>, while the FAT file system is used on smaller devices such as memory cards and USB drives. This file system allows maximum partitions of up to 16 EiB theoretically, although the limitation currently depends on the operating system.</p>
<p><strong>NTFS</strong> improves on the FAT file system by including improved support for metadata, providing more robust security, and improving performance by not relying on underlying hardware, since there is no special location on the partition to store the allocation table, which in this system is called the master file table and contains information about the files and directories stored on the partition. There is at least one entry in the master file table for each file.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata</strong> is information that describes the characteristics of the data, such as the file name, the date it was created, the date it was last modified, the size of the file, the permissions, etc.</p>
<p>In the case of <strong>GNU/Linux</strong>, the most common file systems are <strong>ext4</strong>, <strong>XFS</strong>, <strong>JFS</strong>, <strong>ReiserFS</strong>, <strong>Btrfs</strong>, <strong>ZFS</strong>, etc.</p>
<p><strong>ext4</strong> is the most used file system in GNU/Linux distributions. Allows partitions of up to 1 EiB and files of up to 16 TiB. It is a file system that has been optimized for performance and reliability.</p>
<h4 id="formatting-a-partition">Formatting a partition<a class="headerlink" href="#formatting-a-partition" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Formatting a partition is the process of preparing it for use on our computer. When we format a partition we are creating a file system that can be read and written depending on the operating system we installed.</p>
<p>Formatting a partition will result in the <strong>loss of all the information</strong> contained on it.</p>
<h3 id="boot-loader">Boot loader<a class="headerlink" href="#boot-loader" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The boot loader is responsible for locating and loading operating system into main memory. If there are several operating systems installed, the user will select which one to start.</p>
<p>We can choose choose to use the default boot loader or install and configure custom one.</p>
<p>In <em>MS Windows</em> operating systems, the BCD (Boot Configuration Data) database is used for systems not managed with BIOS. It is encrypted and requires administrator permissions to manage it, using the <code>bcedit</code> command or other graphical tools.</p>
<p>The <code>msconfig</code> tool allows you to manage the boot of different systems using a graphical interface.</p>
<p>In <em>GNU/Linux</em> operating systems, the boot loader is usually <strong>GRUB</strong> (GRand Unified Bootloader). It is a boot loader that allows you to boot different operating systems installed on the computer. It is the most widely used boot loader in GNU/Linux distributions.</p>
<h3 id="installation-type">Installation type<a class="headerlink" href="#installation-type" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The installation type will depend on the needs of the user and the computer where the operating system will be installed. The most common types of installation are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typical installation</strong>. This is the most common type of installation. It is a step-by-step installation wizard that guides the user through the installation process.</li>
<li><strong>Unattended installation</strong>. This type of installation is used when you want to install an operating system without user intervention. It is useful when you need to install the same operating system on multiple computers.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced installation</strong>. This type of installation is used when you want to install multiple operating systems on the same computer. It allows you to configure the partitions and file systems manually.</li>
<li><strong>Image installation</strong>. This type of installation is used when you want to install an operating system from a previously cloned image. This is useful when you need to install the same operating system on multiple computers or when you need to restore the operating system to a previous state.</li>
<li><strong>Network installation</strong>. This type of installation is used when you want to install an operating system from a server to multiple computers. It is useful when you need to install the same operating system on multiple computers at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cloning">Cloning<a class="headerlink" href="#cloning" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>If many computer systems need to be installed, the cloning technique will make our work easier. Cloning replicates an operating system installed on a source computer on one or more destination computers.</p>
<p>One of the most commonly used options by computer technicians who are dedicated to computer maintenance is cloning the information contained on hard drives. One way to automate the process of installing an operating system on a new machine, or moving the installation from one hard drive to another with a larger capacity on the same machine or on a different machine, is to clone an existing system.</p>
<p>Computer cloning is the process of making an <strong>exact copy of the information</strong> from one disk to another or from one partition to another. The objective of this process is to safeguard the information or to use the cloned information to be able to access it quickly and easily on other computer equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>. Install the same operating system on multiple computers without having to install it manually on each one.</li>
<li><strong>Backup</strong>. Create a backup copy of the operating system and all applications and documents on the hard drive in order to restore them in case of a failure.</li>
<li><strong>Drive upgrade</strong>. Move the operating system and all applications and documents from a smaller hard drive to a larger one.</li>
<li><strong>Forensic analysis</strong>. Create a copy of the hard drive to analyze it without altering the original data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The computer tools used to clone computer systems are classified, based on their ability to access the operating system, into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clone storage device</strong>. Exact copy of the hard drive. It's a bit-by-bit copy of the storage drive, including the partition table, the boot sector and all the partitions. It's agnostic to the file system.</li>
<li><strong>Clone partition</strong>. If we only want to clone a partition, we can use this tool. It's a bit-by-bit copy of the partition, including the file system.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also possible to clone virtual machines that contain operating systems inside. This type of cloning consists of making a copy of a virtual machine. The source machine of the copy is called the parent virtual machine, and the copy of the virtual machine is called the child virtual machine. Within virtual machine cloning we can talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete virtual machine cloning</strong>. This is a type of cloning in which the copy of a virtual machine is completely independent of the virtual machine from which it has been copied.</li>
<li><strong>Linked virtual machine cloning</strong>. This is a type of cloning in which the parent virtual machine and the child virtual machine share the same virtual disk.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>The installation of an operating system is a process that consists of transferring the operating system to the computer and configuring it so that it is ready for use.</p>
<p>The installation process is usually done through an installation wizard that guides the user through the installation process. The installation wizard will ask the user for information such as the language to be used, the time zone, the keyboard layout, the partitions to be created, the file system to be used, etc.</p>
<p>The installation process is divided into steps, some of which are optional and others are mandatory. The steps of the installation process may vary depending on the operating system being installed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Language selection</strong>. The user must select the language in which the installation process will be carried out.</li>
<li><strong>Time zone selection</strong>. The user must select the time zone in which the computer is located.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard layout selection</strong>. The user must select the keyboard layout to be used.</li>
<li><strong>License agreement</strong>. The user must accept the license agreement of the operating system.</li>
<li><strong>Partitioning</strong>. The user must create the partitions on the hard drive where the operating system will be installed.</li>
<li><strong>File system selection</strong>. The user must select the file system to be used on the partitions.</li>
<li><strong>Installation</strong>. The operating system is installed on the hard drive.</li>
<li><strong>Post-installation configuration</strong>. Configure parameters after the installation process is completed, such as the location, time zone, keyboard layout, users, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Admin user creation</strong>. The user must create an administrator user who will have full control over the computer.</li>
<li><strong>Installation completion</strong>. The installation process is completed and the computer is ready after the installation medium is removed and the computer is restarted.</li>

<p>In a virtual machine, the installation wizard may not allow us to continue because it detects that the computer does not have a TPM module.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>TPM module</strong> is a hardware component that is used to store cryptographic keys and protect sensitive information. It is used to encrypt the hard drive and protect the operating system from unauthorized access.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Boot</strong> is a security feature that ensures that the operating system is not manipulated with during the boot process. It is a feature that is enabled by default on most computers that have a TPM module.</p>
<p><strong>Ram Check</strong> is a feature that checks the amount of RAM installed on the computer and ensures that it meets the minimum requirements of the operating system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To bypass these checks, we must open the <strong>command line</strong> using the key combination <strong><code>Shift</code></strong>+<strong><code>F10</code></strong>, and execute the command <em><code>regedit</code></em>:</p>

<p><em>GNU/Linux</em> operating systems are usually distributed in packages known as <strong>distributions</strong> or <em><strong>distros</strong></em>. Each distribution has its own selection of applications installed on the operating system to meet the needs of specific users.</p>
<p>A <strong>distribution</strong> of an operating system is software that includes the <strong>operating system and certain applications to meet the needs of a specific group of users</strong>. Given a source distribution, there may be different editions, such as for home, business, or server use.</p>
<p>Currently, one of the most popular distributions is <em>Ubuntu</em>, a <em>GNU/Linux</em> distribution maintained by the company <em>Canonical</em> and aimed at both desktop users and server and cloud computing environments, but we can find many more. Among the most popular are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Free operating systems based on GNU/Linux</strong>. Family of operating systems made up of the <em><strong>Linux kernel</strong></em> together with the <em><strong>GNU utilities</strong></em>. The Linux operating system kernel was created in 1991 in Helsinki by <em>Linus Torvalds</em>. The <em>GNU</em> utilities, necessary for a complete operating system, have their origin in <em>Richard Stallman</em>'s project to create a free operating system, which began in 1985 at the <em>Free Software Foundation</em> (FSF). Linux grew thanks to the collaborative work of programmers from all over the world. Today, there are many software distributions based on this operating system, the main distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Debian</strong>. It is a <em>GNU/Linux</em> distribution created by a community of developers and users in 1993. This association of people united by the cause of creating a 100% free operating system, and called it the <em>Debian Project</em>. It is also considered a mother distribution, since countless distributions such as <em>Ubuntu</em>, <em>Linux Mint</em>, <em>SteamOS</em>, <em>Kali Linux</em>, <em>PureOs</em>, <em>Deepin</em>, among many others, were born from <em>Debian</em>.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Debian codenames</p>
<p>Debian distribution codenames are based on the names of characters from the <em>Toy Story</em> films. Debian's unstable trunk is named after <em>Sid</em>, a character who regularly destroyed his toys. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_version_history">Wikipedia - Debian version history</a></p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ubuntu</strong>. Distribution based on <em>Debian</em>, developed and maintained by the company <em>Canonical</em>, being one of the most used. It is oriented to general uses and is characterized by its software compatibility and ease of use comparable to <em>Mac OS X</em> or <em>Windows</em>. It has several versions, among which the following stand out: <em>Ubuntu Desktop</em>, <em>Kubuntu</em>, <em>Xubuntu</em>, <em>Lubuntu</em> and <em>Ubuntu Server</em>.</p>
<p>A new version of <em>Ubuntu</em> is published every six months. It receives support from <em>Canonical</em> for nine months through security updates, patches for critical bugs and minor program updates. The <strong>LTS</strong> (Long Term Support) versions, which are released every two years, receive support for five years on desktop and server systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fedora</strong>. General purpose distribution, which makes use of the <em>RPM</em> package. It is characterized by being stable and secure, which is developed and maintained by the company <em>Red Hat</em> and an international community of engineers, graphic designers and users who report errors and test new technologies. Its uses are more oriented towards software and server development. The project does not only seek to include free and open source software, but to be the leader in this technological field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Slackware</strong>. It is a <em>GNU/Linux</em> distribution created in 1993 and aimed at advanced users. This distribution derived from <em>SLS Linux</em> and is the oldest distribution still in maintenance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open SUSE</strong>. <em>SUSE</em> is an operating system with paid versions for both servers and desktops called <em>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</em> and <em>SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop</em>. It was originally based on <em>Slackware</em>. <em>SUSE</em> also offers a completely free version called <em>Open SUSE</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arch Linux</strong>. It is a distribution aimed at advanced users. It is mostly made up of free and open source software and supports community participation. It has few automatic configuration tools, sharing the same philosophy of distributions like <em>Slackware​</em>. It's development model is of the type <em><strong>Rolling Release</strong></em> and the design approach follows the <em>KISS</em> principle to keep the system simple and light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manjaro</strong>. <em>Manjaro Linux</em> is based on <em>Arch Linux</em>, but has its own set of repositories. The distribution aims to be user-friendly while maintaining the features of <em>Arch</em>, such as the <em>Pacman</em> package manager and compatibility with <em>AUR</em> (<em>Arch User's Repository</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other distributions</strong>. There are many more distributions derived from the above, such as <em>MX Linux</em>, <em>Pop!_OS</em>, <em>Mint</em>, <em>Kali</em>, <em>Garuda</em>, <em>Zorin</em>, <em>antiX</em>, <em>Alpine</em>, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Free operating systems based on <em>BSD</em></strong>: These are operating systems derived from the <em>BSD</em> (<em>Berkeley Software Distribution</em>) operating system, which originally derived from the <em>UNIX</em> operating system from <em>AT&amp;T Research</em>. The best known are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>FreeBSD</strong>. The most popular <em>BSD</em> distribution that aims to provide high performance and ease of use. It is a distribution very oriented towards desktop use that includes basic applications for the user such as browser, word processor, games, email, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OpenBSD</strong>. This distribution is oriented towards security and code integrity. It integrates a large number of cryptographic tools to maximize security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NetBSD</strong>. This distribution aims to make the operating system as portable as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other free operating systems</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chromium OS</strong>. <em>Chromiun OS</em> is the free operating system of the <em>Chrome OS</em> version. <em>Chrome OS</em> is an operating system developed by <em>Google</em> that is based on the <em>Linux</em> kernel and uses the <em>Google Chrome</em> browser as a user interface. This operating system is designed to work with web applications. <em>Chrome OS</em> is the proprietary commercial version that comes installed on specific hardware created by some of <em>Google</em>'s partners, such as the <em>Chromebook</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Android</strong>. It is a mobile operating system based on the <em>Linux</em> kernel. It was designed for mobile devices with touch screens, such as <em>smartphones</em>, tablets, televisions, etc.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="linux-distributions-technical-support">Linux distributions technical support<a class="headerlink" href="#linux-distributions-technical-support" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>With the installation of an operating system we receive technical support and updates that keep the equipment up to date until the end of its useful life. This support can be commercial if the user has paid for it or free support offered by the community of users of the installed distribution.</p>
<p>Linux distributions offer several possibilities to <strong>keep the system up to date</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Standard development</strong>. One option is to use a <strong>standard development model</strong> of updating that uses different <strong>versions</strong> that have to be reinstalled over the previous version.</p>
<p>An example of this is <em>Debian</em>, which has different versions such as <em>Debian 10 "buster"</em> or <em>Debian 11 "bullseye"</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rolling release</strong>. The other option is a model of constant updating of the different software packages that is called <strong>continuous update</strong>, or <strong>rolling release</strong>.</p>
<p>An example of this is <em>Arch Linux</em>, which is a distribution that is constantly updated and does not have versions. The user installs the system once and then updates it continuously.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of systems that use the <strong>standard development model</strong>, the terms <em>STS</em> and <em>LTS</em> are widely used for free software and specify how long its technical support lasts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>STS</strong>. Short-term support, <em>STS</em> for its acronym for <em><strong>Short Term Support</strong></em>. These operating systems have newer software with more recent features but that can be more unstable, since these programs are not sufficiently tested by the user community. In favor of these versions we find that they provide newer or more experimental applications and allow us to enjoy the latest news.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LTS</strong>. <em>LTS</em> versions, which stand for <em><strong>Long Term Support</strong></em>, are more stable because the software has been in use for a while. This is the term used to refer to software versions that are designed to be supported for a longer period than usual. For example, the <em>Ubuntu LTS</em> operating system provides support for five years while the <em>Ubuntu STS</em> version only provides support for nine months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="storage-devices-and-file-systems-in-gnulinux">Storage devices and file systems in GNU/Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-devices-and-file-systems-in-gnulinux" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>In <em>GNU/Linux</em> systems, partitions have different names than those used by other operating systems such as <em>MS Windows</em>. For example, in <em>MS Windows</em>, hard drives and partitions are identified with the letters <code>C:</code>, <code>D:</code> and so on; while in <em>GNU/Linux</em> we find a nomenclature such as <code>/dev/sda1</code> or <code>/dev/sdb5</code>.</p>
<p>In <em>GNU/Linux</em> the first hard drive is called <code>/dev/sda</code> and its partitions are numbered in an order where the primary and extended partitions are numbered first, and then the logical ones. For example, <code>/dev/sda1</code>, <code>/dev/sda2</code>, <code>/dev/sda3</code>, and <code>/dev/sda4</code> could be primary or extended partitions, and <code>/dev/sda5</code>, <code>/dev/sda6</code>, etc. could be logical partitions. If we had a second hard drive, it would be named the same but with the letter <code>b</code>, i.e. <code>/dev/sdb</code>. This last letter will always be assigned by the operating system based on the disk controller channel or USB port where the device is connected.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Nomenclature of hard drives in GNU/Linux</p>
<p>Traditionally, <em>IDE</em> hard drives were named <code>/dev/hda</code>, <code>/dev/hdb</code>, etc., and <em>SCSI</em> hard drives were named <code>/dev/sda</code>, <code>/dev/sdb</code>. Since 2007, the nomenclature has been standardized and, regardless of the technology used, the old nomenclature for <em>SCSI</em> disks is currently used.</p>
</div>
<p>In addition to this nomenclature, the different partitions that can be used by the operating system have an identifier called <strong>UUID</strong> (<em>Universally Unique Identifier</em>) that allows the partition to be referenced independently of the disk controller channel or USB port where the device has been connected.</p>
<h4 id="partition-schemes_1">Partition schemes<a class="headerlink" href="#partition-schemes_1" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The standard partition scheme for most home <em>Linux</em> installations is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A partition of about <strong>20 GB</strong> for the operating system, which is mounted at <code>/</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>smaller</strong> partition used for swap memory, called <strong><em>swap</em></strong>. The size of this space will depend on the use of the system and the amount of RAM available to the system. For example, if you do a lot of multimedia editing and/or have a small amount of RAM, you should use a larger amount of swap. The general rule is that you create a swap partition that is 100% to 200% of the size of the physical RAM on the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>larger</strong> partition for personal use by the system user(s), mounted at <code>/home</code>. This is where personal data is stored. It is the equivalent of the <code>C:\Users</code> directory in <em>MS Windows</em>, which stores application settings, music, downloads, documents, etc. Strictly speaking, it is not necessary to create a separate partition for <code>/home</code>. If you do not, it will reside on the root partition like everything else on the system. But it is useful to have <code>/home</code> on a separate partition because when you upgrade or reinstall the operating system, you do not need to back up this folder. In addition, most of the settings related to programs and the user interface are also saved.</p>
</li>

<p>On a computer intended to be a server for many users, system performance can be optimized by using more than one hard drive and by creating a partition layout specific to the server's activity. In addition to the partition for the operating system, the swap partition, and the <code>/home</code> partition, other partitions can be created, such as for the temporary directory (<code>/tmp</code>), for web server content (<code>/var/www</code>), for programs (<code>/usr</code>), or for log files (<code>/var/log</code>).</p>

<h2 id="verification-and-documentation-of-the-installation-process-and-incidents">Verification and documentation of the installation process and incidents<a class="headerlink" href="#verification-and-documentation-of-the-installation-process-and-incidents" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once we have installed and configured the operating systems, we must check that they are working correctly. Then we must prepare the documentation corresponding to the installation process and the incidents that have appeared. This documentation refers to the set of documents that are issued accompanying the installation process. The most important document in this set is the installation manual.</p>
<p>The purpose of the installation manual is to serve as a guide during the installation of the system. Therefore, first of all we must specify the technical requirements and the software necessary for the correct operation of the system, and then describe each of the steps necessary for its installation and configuration.</p>
<p>The documentation is usually in computer support, and we can find it in different types, such as text, graphics or multimedia (if it includes images, videos, etc.). We can find it in physical format if the documentation is printed or in online format if it is consulted on the Internet.</p>
<p>The documentation is mainly classified into help documentation, which usually explains the installation; support documentation, which tries to resolve the most common incidents; Technical documentation, which includes the operating system's technical specifications; general documentation, which presents the operating system and its functions; and legal documentation, which usually contains the legal conditions for using the operating system. We can also find other more specific documents, such as documents on frequently asked questions (FAQs), glossaries, etc.</p>
<h2 id="virtualbox-guest-additions"><em>VirtualBox Guest Additions</em><a class="headerlink" href="#virtualbox-guest-additions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>VirtualBox Guest Additions</em> is a software that can be installed on guest operating systems that provides some enhanced accessibility features and improves guest system performance. After installing an operating system on <em>VirtualBox</em>, it is highly recommended to install <em>VirtualBox Guest Additions</em>.</p>
<p>Specifically, the benefits we get are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mouse pointer integration</strong>: Allows you to move the mouse freely between the host and guest operating systems.</li>
<li><strong>Shared folders</strong>: Provides the ability to access one or more folders on the host operating system from the guest operating system, simplifying the exchange of information between the two.</li>
<li><strong>Improved video support</strong>: Allows the guest system to benefit from the advanced video modes and graphics acceleration of the host (both 2D and 3D). In addition, if the guest system is MS Windows, GNU/Linux or Solaris, we can choose any video resolution, whether standard or not.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Windows</strong>: Allows you to display the virtual machine's desktop windows integrated into the host desktop, as if they were your own windows.</li>
<li><strong>Generic Guest-Host Communication Channel</strong>: Allows you to control and monitor the guest system. This allows, for example, launching applications on the guest from the host.</li>
<li>System Clock Synchronization: Improved system clock synchronization between the host and the guest.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Clipboard</strong>: Allows you to share the contents of the guest system's clipboard with the host's and vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong>: Allows you to drag files from the host computer to the guest computer or vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Authentication</strong>: Provides the ability to log in with a guest system user account from the host system.</li>
</ul>
